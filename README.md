## Requirements

Before running, ensure you have access to:
- R (Version 4.0.1 or later)
  - Required packages:
    - XML
    - igraph
    - brainGraph
    - ggplot2
    - rstatix
    - ggpubr

## Analysis of experimental data

You will find all raw trajectory files from TrackMate export in the subdirectories
mtgfp-rawtrajectories
msh1-rawtrajectories
friendly-rawtrajectories

The script to process trajectories, and export adjacency matrices, trajectories, summary statistics, mitochondrial colocalisation time and mitochondrial speeds is newPipelinev6.R 

To run, use:

Rscript `newPipelinev6.R` [input XML file] [threshold] [any frames for which to output graph plots]

```sh
./newPipelinev6.R test.xml 1.6 1 50 100
```

Threshold here means the encounter threshold. We used 1.6Âµm to count as an encounter between two mitochondria. 


Graph plotting and statistical analysis was done using scripts
`msh1MSGraphs.R` For Figure 4, S6, S7
`msh1MSGraphs-noFR.R` For Figure 2, 3
`CellSizesQuantify.R` For Figure S5 using CellSizesQuantify.csv as input

All video data will be made available in subdirectories 

mtgfp-videos
msh1-videos
friendly-videos
